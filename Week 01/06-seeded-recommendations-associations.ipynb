    "# 📚 Recommendations based on Frequently Reviewed Together (association rules)\n",
    "For the final segment of this assignment, refer to section 5.4 of the _Practical Recommender Systems_ book (pages 113-127). After reading, download the code provided by the book and focus on the `association_rules_calculator.py` in the `builder` directory. Your task is to adapt this code for use in this notebook, translating its steps into a format suitable for our environment. Here's a simplified outline based on the source code:\n",

    "1. Load the data\n",

    "4. Save the results"

You can reuse the subroutines in the source code and pass along the list containing the reviews belonging together. Play around with the _minimum support_ parameter. Too strict will result in fewer associations."
